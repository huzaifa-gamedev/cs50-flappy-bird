# 🐦 CS50 — Flappy Bird

**Course:** [CS50's Introduction to Game Development](https://cs50.harvard.edu/games/)  
**Assignment:** Flappy Bird  
**Engine / Language:** LÖVE2D (Lua)  

---

## 📋 Project Overview

This repository contains my implementation of the **Flappy Bird** assignment from CS50's Introduction to Game Development.

---

### What I implemented:

- ✔️ Randomized the **gap** between pipes instead of hardcoding.  
- ✔️ Randomized the **spawn interval** for pipe pairs.  
- ✔️ Awarded the player with **medals** (3 types) depending on score.  
- ✔️ Added a **pause feature** (toggle with "P") that stops gameplay, pauses music, and shows a pause icon.  
- ✔️ Preserved the original flapping mechanics (space bar / mouse click).
